> Agroww is an AI-powered "Legal Iron Dome" for farmers, converting complex contract legalese into a simple Safety Score.

## 🚨 The Problem
Indian farmers often sign contract farming agreements they cannot read or understand.
* **Hidden Clauses:** "Force Majeure" traps that refuse payment during rain.
* **Zero Liability:** Buyers often shift 100% of pest/crop failure risk to the farmer.
* **Language Barrier:** Contracts are in complex English; farmers speak local dialects.

## 💡 The Solution: Agroww Enterprise
Agroww is a **Corporate-Grade Audit Dashboard** that acts as a farmer's personal legal team. Instead of confusing text, we provide:
1.  **Safety Score (0-100):** A single metric to decide if a contract is safe.
2.  **Risk Badges:** 🚨 **CRITICAL** vs ✅ **SAFE** visual indicators.
3.  **Plain English Breakdown:** Explains *why* a clause is dangerous in 2 sentences.
